- What is accessibility?
- Myths & Truths
    - Just for a few people
        - 10% is not a few
        - what about situational or temporary impairments
        - done correctly, accessibility almost always increases usability for everyone
        - if we don't die suddenly - we will all have impairments
    - It's an enhancement and it is hard
        - visual and functional "enhancements" are what broke it in the first place
            - Valid HTML is nearly always accessible
            - CSS can hide or obscure information
            - JavaScript can really bork everything
        - ui is hard
        - starting from a good foundation (HTML and components) creates better and more maintainable ui

                - As a human being I want to perceive, operate, and understand the information and
                functionality of a web page using the software, tools and in the environment that I
                use to interact with the rest of the web, now and in the future.
        - Adopt heuristics (rules of thumb/mental models)
            - If meaning is conveyed visually - can it also be determined programmatically
                - proximity
                - contrast
                - color
                - images
                - borders
                - font or text settings
            - Can all functionality be accessed via keyboard?
            - Will it work in any situation that it might be used?
                - device, browser, screen reader, zoomed in, etc.
            - First rule of aria is not to use aria except if you must
