# Debunking Some Common Accessibility Myths

---

# 1. Myth: I don't have any disabled users
 - ~20% of the US population has a permanent disability.
    - 12% have a severe disability
    - Disabled people most harshly affected by design & implementation
        - Nausea, headaches
        - Seizures
        - Physical Strain (or injury)
        - Frustration and Stress

# 2. Myth: Accessibility is Hard
 - So is JavaScript, Backend development, etc. 
    - Experience + Knowledge biggest difference
    - Semantic, Functional HTML is mostly accessible
      - "Enhancements" vis CSS/JS break and obscure accessible features
      - Starting with accessibility always easier than trying to fix it later
