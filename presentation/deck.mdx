# Debunking Some Common Accessibility Myths

---

# 1. Myth: I don't have any disabled users
 - ~20% of the US population has a permanent disability.
    - 12% have a severe disability
    - Disabled people most harshly affected by design & implementation
        - Nausea, headaches
        - Seizures
        - Physical Strain (or injury)
        - Frustration and Stress

---

# 2. Myth: Accessibility is Hard
 - So is JavaScript, Backend development, etc. 
    - Experience + Knowledge biggest difference
    - Semantic, Functional HTML is mostly accessible
      - "Enhancements" vis CSS/JS break and obscure accessible features
      - Starting with accessibility always easier than trying to fix it later

<Notes>


- Perceivable: User can identify content via the senses
- Operable: User can successfuly use the interactive elements
- Understandable: Uses consistency, predictability, and other features to allow users to comprehend the content
- Robust: Functions regardless of technology (browsers, AT, etc)

# POUR
  - Perceivable
  - Operable
  - Understandable
  - Robust

# Tooling
- Accessibility Insights for Web
   - Chrome/Chromium Edge
   - Has automated, assisted, and manual test
   - Extensive
- [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-cli)
   - CLI & browser Tool for checking common a11y problems
   - Can be baked into CI/CD pipelines
   - Not a replacement for manual tests

# Keyboard Testing

Everything you can access with your mouse needs to be accessible via keyboard

- Focus Styles
- Skip Links


[someExample](https://example.com)

---

# Color Contrast

- 4.5:1 Normal Text (< 24px, < 19 pixels when bolded )
- 3:1 Large Text, graphics, and user interface components
- Links without underlines need 3:1 with body text in addition to above (plus focus/hover styles)

---



# Zoom & Font Size

## Some users need to zoom or use screen magnifiers
- Responsive design helps
- 400% zoom is standard for Testing

## Some users adjust font sizes
- Use responsive units for font sizes instead of pixels (em/rem)
- Can test by editing browser settings

---

# Labels & Accessible Names

- Assitive Tech needs to be able to announce content
- Images need accessibility
- Buttons and form elements need accessible Names
  - Not just icons for Buttons
  - `<Label>` for Form elements with `id`
  - Only use aria-label when abxsolutely necessary
- Can add additional information to AT with `aria-describedby`

---

# Aria 
- Conveys additional meaning to Assistive technology
- Prefer Semantic HTML over ARIA where possible
- Is needed for certain custom components (modals, collapsable menus, etc)
